# Templates, Examples and Problems Of Data Structure and Algorithm

# Overview
This project is orgnaized by the following structure
> **[src](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src)** serve as template records for training
> >**[basis](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/basis)** are some basic usage of date structure and algorithm

> >**[data_strcuture](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/data_strcuture)** are some commonly used data structures

> >**[dp](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/dp)** are summaries of dynamic programming


> >**[graph](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/graph)** are some simple and classic graph theory algorithms 


> >**[greedy](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/greedy)** are some classic greedy problems


> >**[mathmatics](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/mathmatics)** are mathematics related algorithms


>> **[search](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/search)** are bfs, dfs and meet in middle

>> **[strings](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/src/strings)** are some classic usages of strings

>>> **template.py** have some data structure and algorithm templates



>>> **example.py** have some unit tests of the related templates



>>> **problem.py** have some problems which can be solved by the related 



> **[tests](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/tests)** serve as work space during competitions

> > **[codeforces](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/tests/codeforces)** prepared for codeforces, luogu, atcoder, acwing and so on

> > **[leetcode](https://github.com/liupengsay/PyIsTheBestLang/tree/main/tests/leetcode)** prepared for leetcode only

>>> **template.py** is duplicate template for copy and paste before starting to solve the problem
